# Installation

Robindoc is simply a helper framework, meaning it does not include React itself or its frameworks.

If you do not yet have an application, initialize it according to the [Next.js guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation).

Install the `robindoc` package in your project:

```bash switcher tab="npm"
npm i robindoc
```

```bash switcher tab="pnpm"
pnpm add robindoc
```

```bash switcher tab="yarn"
yarn add robindoc
```

```bash switcher tab="bun"
bun add robindoc
```

Now you can fully integrate it into your application by [initializing Robindoc](./03-initialization.md) guide.
