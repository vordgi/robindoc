# Installation

Robindoc is simply a helper framework, meaning it does not include React itself or its frameworks. _If you do not yet have an application, initialize it according to the instructions._

If you already have an application on a framework that supports RSC, simply install the `robindoc` package. After that, you can fully integrate it into your application by [initializing Robindoc](./03-initialization.md).

**Using npm:**

```bash switcher tab="npm"
npm i robindoc
```

```bash switcher tab="yarn"
yarn add robindoc
```
