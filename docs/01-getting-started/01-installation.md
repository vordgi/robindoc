# Installation

Robindoc is simply a helper framework, meaning it does not include React itself or its frameworks. Additionally, Robindoc does not depend on any specific solutions.

If you do not yet have an application, initialize it according to the instructions of the framework you are comfortable with (that supports RSC).

If you already have an application on a framework that supports RSC, simply install the `robindoc` package. After that, you can fully integrate it into your application by [initializing Robindoc](./initialization.md).

**Using npm:**

```bash switcher tab="npm"
npm i robindoc
```

```bash switcher tab="yarn"
yarn add robindoc
```
