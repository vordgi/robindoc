`blockquote` is a standard markdown element that allows you to highlight text or quote information

```md

```

> Basic information that is additional or related to the main text.

Robindoc additionally supports the [GitHub alerts format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). This way you can highlight important information more clearly.
