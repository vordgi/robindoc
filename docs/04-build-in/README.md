# Build-in blocks

Robindoc provides several built-in extensions for markdown.

Since the framework is focused specifically on markdown. This makes it possible to maintain the same style for all platforms. The user can quickly view the original files, and then use the full documentation site. And in both cases he will receive all the necessary information.

However, in all non-standard situations you can [use JSX](../01-getting-started/02-writing-md.md).

## Current extensions

- [Blockquotes](./01-blockquotes.md)

- _Documentation under development_
