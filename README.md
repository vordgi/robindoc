Robindoc is a framework for automatically creating documentation websites based on markdown files, built on React.js Server Components.

```tsx filename="app/docs/page.tsx" switcher tab="TypeScript" clone="jsx|JavaScript|app/docs/page.jsx"
const DocumentationPage = () => (
  <RobinProvider>
    <Header logo={<Logo />} />
    <DocsContainer>
      <Sidebar pathname="/docs" />
      <Page pathname="/docs" />
    </DocsContainer>
    <Footer copyright="© 2024 All rights reserved" />
  </RobinProvider>
);
```

The main goal of Robindoc is to create a system where you can fully reuse the existing markdown documentation within your projects.

No additional configuration is needed, while preserving the accessibility and clarity of the original documentation.
